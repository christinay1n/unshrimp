# Teachable Machine Pose Trigger Demo

This project demonstrates a machine learning model made using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/),
a tool that let's anyone make machine learning models without writing any code. 

We trained a model to detect posture! It tells you whether you have good posture or what type of bad posture you are most likely dealing with, and provides advice on how to correct your posture!
